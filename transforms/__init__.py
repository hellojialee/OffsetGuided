"""Transform input data.
 Import functions from this package can facilitate reference in other package.

OpenCV-resize() regards the pixels lies at the center of cells in the image array.
The origin (0, 0) of the coordinate system lies at the center of the op-left cell.

OpenCV-warpaffine() regards the pixels as dots without areas, thus in this case the origin
(0, 0) of the coordinate system lies at the top-left pixel.

A rectangle is denoted as the format (x,y,w,h), e.g. (0, 0, 800, 600).
